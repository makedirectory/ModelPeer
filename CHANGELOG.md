# Changelog

All notable changes to Model Peer are documented here.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-09

### Added

- `--depth N` on `ask` and `review`, plus `MODEL_PEER_MAX_DEPTH`, to cap peer-chain
  length. Default `1` (a peer answers alone), ceiling `10`. The limit propagates
  down the chain, so a peer cannot raise its own ceiling.
- Depth-aware consultation prompts: peers are told how much chain depth remains and
  whether they may delegate.
- Delegation as a concept distinct from depth. Depth is a limit and never a
  permission; delegation is the separate permission to initiate a further
  consultation, granted only where a provider can scope it to Model Peer alone.
  Claude gets `Bash` auto-approved solely for `Bash(model-peer:*)`; Codex gains no
  new capability at all; Gemini never delegates, because its policy engine can only
  allow or deny `run_shell_command` wholesale. A depth budget a provider cannot
  safely hold is reported on stderr rather than converted into a wider sandbox.
- `model-peer doctor` reports the per-provider nested-consultation matrix, the
  effective depth limit, and any active chain.
- `make sync` / `tools/sync-installer.sh` to regenerate the copy of `bin/model-peer`
  embedded in `install.sh`, and `make check-sync` to fail the build on drift.
- `tools/bump-version.sh` to rewrite the release string everywhere it is duplicated.

### Changed

- `MODEL_PEER_STACK` is now a depth-bearing chain (`claude:codex`) rather than a
  membership marker. The self-consultation guard still applies at every depth.
- `model-peer review` no longer overwrites `MODEL_PEER_STACK`, so a review launched
  from inside a peer chain stays subject to the depth guard instead of escaping it.
- The review synthesizer is always a leaf and never consults a peer, at any depth.
- Agent rules consolidated to a single `examples/AGENTS.md` template intended to be
  symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`; the per-vendor example copies are gone.
- This repository now carries its own `AGENTS.md` under that layout.

### Fixed

- CI had never passed on this repository. `make lint` failed shellcheck from the
  first commit (`SC2034`: `PROGRAM` was set but never used). `err` now uses it, and
  the lint target is clean on both ubuntu and macOS runners.
- Smoke-test stubs used `read -t 0.05`, which is invalid on the Bash 3.2 that macOS
  ships and printed an error on every stubbed call.
- The README's one-line install pointed at a `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` placeholder, so
  the documented `curl` command could never have worked.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-07

### Added

- `model-peer` root CLI.
- `model-peer ask claude`, `model-peer ask codex`, and `model-peer ask gemini`.
- `model-peer review` with independent multi-model review and final synthesis.
- Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Google Gemini CLI support.
- Read-only consultation defaults for all three providers.
- Gemini Plan mode plus explicit temporary deny policy.
- `MODEL_PEER_STACK` recursion protection.
- Compatibility shortcuts: `ask-claude`, `ask-codex`, `ask-gemini`, `ai-review`.
- `model-peer doctor` setup diagnostics.
- Self-contained installer, uninstaller, example agent rules, and stub smoke tests.

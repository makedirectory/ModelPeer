# Changelog

All notable changes to Model Peer are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `model-peer init` (alias for `model-peer rules install`) installs the
  cross-model consultation rules into a repository, closing the gap between
  having the command installed globally and the agent in a project ever using it.
  Default layout is one shared `AGENTS.md` with `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`
  symlinked to it; `--split` writes one tailored file per CLI, each addressing
  that model directly and naming its two peers. `--agents`, `--dir`,
  `--no-command`, `--dry-run`, and `--force` narrow or preview the result.
- Rules are written between `<!-- BEGIN MODEL PEER RULES -->` and
  `<!-- END MODEL PEER RULES -->`. Content outside the markers is never rewritten,
  so `init` is idempotent, appends below an existing `AGENTS.md`, and refreshes in
  place after an upgrade.
- `model-peer rules print [--profile P] [--command]` writes the rules to stdout
  without touching a file.
- `model-peer rules check` verifies that every managed block matches what the
  installed version would write; exits `1` when a block is missing or stale, for
  CI. It reads each block's recorded profile, so both layouts verify correctly.
- `.claude/commands/peer-review.md`, giving Claude Code a `/peer-review` slash
  command that runs a cross-model review of the current diff and reports the
  synthesis with its own agreement or disagreement. Skip it with `--no-command`.
- `model-peer doctor` now reports whether the current project has rules installed.
- Documentation: a new "In your workflow" page covering the three moments
  consultation actually happens, team rollout, and CI verification. `agent-rules`
  now explains what the rules say rather than how to copy a file.

### Changed

- `examples/AGENTS.md` is generated from `model-peer rules print`. `make sync`
  regenerates it and `make check-sync` fails the build on drift, so the shipped
  template can no longer disagree with what `init` writes.
- The rules text now tells agents not to consult for anything answerable by
  reading the code, and ends with a stand-down line for a model that loads the
  file while acting as a peer in someone else's consultation.

### Fixed

- `init` writes only paths the vendor CLIs genuinely load: `.claude/rules/**/*.md`
  and `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for Codex, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini.
  A `.codex/rules/*.md` or `.gemini/global_rules.md` file is never read by those
  CLIs — Codex's extra context filenames come from the global
  `project_doc_fallback_filenames` key, not from the repository — so Model Peer
  does not create them.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-09

### Added

- `--depth N` on `ask` and `review`, plus `MODEL_PEER_MAX_DEPTH`, to cap peer-chain
  length. Default `1` (a peer answers alone), ceiling `10`. The limit propagates
  down the chain, so a peer cannot raise its own ceiling.
- Depth-aware consultation prompts: peers are told how much chain depth remains and
  whether they may delegate.
- Delegation as a concept distinct from depth. Depth is a limit and never a
  permission; delegation is the separate permission to initiate a further
  consultation, granted only where a provider can scope it to Model Peer alone.
  Claude gets `Bash` auto-approved solely for `Bash(model-peer:*)`; Codex gains no
  new capability at all; Gemini never delegates, because its policy engine can only
  allow or deny `run_shell_command` wholesale. A depth budget a provider cannot
  safely hold is reported on stderr rather than converted into a wider sandbox.
- `model-peer doctor` reports the per-provider nested-consultation matrix, the
  effective depth limit, and any active chain.
- `make sync` / `tools/sync-installer.sh` to regenerate the copy of `bin/model-peer`
  embedded in `install.sh`, and `make check-sync` to fail the build on drift.
- `tools/bump-version.sh` to rewrite the release string everywhere it is duplicated.

### Changed

- `MODEL_PEER_STACK` is now a depth-bearing chain (`claude:codex`) rather than a
  membership marker. The self-consultation guard still applies at every depth.
- `model-peer review` no longer overwrites `MODEL_PEER_STACK`, so a review launched
  from inside a peer chain stays subject to the depth guard instead of escaping it.
- The review synthesizer is always a leaf and never consults a peer, at any depth.
- Agent rules consolidated to a single `examples/AGENTS.md` template intended to be
  symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`; the per-vendor example copies are gone.
- This repository now carries its own `AGENTS.md` under that layout.

### Fixed

- CI had never passed on this repository. `make lint` failed shellcheck from the
  first commit (`SC2034`: `PROGRAM` was set but never used). `err` now uses it, and
  the lint target is clean on both ubuntu and macOS runners.
- Smoke-test stubs used `read -t 0.05`, which is invalid on the Bash 3.2 that macOS
  ships and printed an error on every stubbed call.
- The README's one-line install pointed at a `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` placeholder, so
  the documented `curl` command could never have worked.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-07

### Added

- `model-peer` root CLI.
- `model-peer ask claude`, `model-peer ask codex`, and `model-peer ask gemini`.
- `model-peer review` with independent multi-model review and final synthesis.
- Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Google Gemini CLI support.
- Read-only consultation defaults for all three providers.
- Gemini Plan mode plus explicit temporary deny policy.
- `MODEL_PEER_STACK` recursion protection.
- Compatibility shortcuts: `ask-claude`, `ask-codex`, `ask-gemini`, `ai-review`.
- `model-peer doctor` setup diagnostics.
- Self-contained installer, uninstaller, example agent rules, and stub smoke tests.

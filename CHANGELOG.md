# Changelog

All notable changes to Model Peer are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `--depth N` on `ask` and `review`, plus `MODEL_PEER_MAX_DEPTH`, to cap peer-chain
  length. Default `1` (a peer answers alone), ceiling `10`. The limit propagates
  down the chain, so a peer cannot raise its own ceiling.
- Depth-aware consultation prompts: peers are told how much chain depth remains and
  whether they may delegate.
- Above depth 1, peers are granted the minimal tool needed to call out — `Bash`
  auto-approved only for `Bash(model-peer:*)` for Claude, and the `run_shell_command`
  deny rule omitted for Gemini. Write and Plan-mode deny rules always apply.
- `make sync` / `tools/sync-installer.sh` to regenerate the copy of `bin/model-peer`
  embedded in `install.sh`, and `make check-sync` to fail the build on drift.
- `model-peer doctor` reports the effective depth limit and any active chain.

### Changed

- `MODEL_PEER_STACK` is now a depth-bearing chain (`claude:codex`) rather than a
  membership marker. The self-consultation guard still applies at every depth.
- `model-peer review` no longer overwrites `MODEL_PEER_STACK`, so a review launched
  from inside a peer chain stays subject to the depth guard instead of escaping it.
- The review synthesizer is always a leaf and never consults a peer, at any depth.
- Agent rules consolidated to a single `examples/AGENTS.md` template intended to be
  symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`; the per-vendor example copies are gone.
- This repository now carries its own `AGENTS.md` under that layout.

### Fixed

- Smoke-test stubs used `read -t 0.05`, which is invalid on the Bash 3.2 that macOS
  ships and printed an error on every stubbed call.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-07

### Added

- `model-peer` root CLI.
- `model-peer ask claude`, `model-peer ask codex`, and `model-peer ask gemini`.
- `model-peer review` with independent multi-model review and final synthesis.
- Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Google Gemini CLI support.
- Read-only consultation defaults for all three providers.
- Gemini Plan mode plus explicit temporary deny policy.
- `MODEL_PEER_STACK` recursion protection.
- Compatibility shortcuts: `ask-claude`, `ask-codex`, `ask-gemini`, `ai-review`.
- `model-peer doctor` setup diagnostics.
- Self-contained installer, uninstaller, example agent rules, and stub smoke tests.
